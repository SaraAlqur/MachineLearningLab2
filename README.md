Machine Learning Problem Description
The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using passenger-related data. The dataset includes features such as age, gender, passenger class, and ticket fare.
The target variable is Survived, which represents whether a passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0). Because the output consists of two possible classes, this problem is a supervised classification task.
The model is trained to identify patterns between the input features and survival outcomes. After training, the model is used to predict survival for new passengers. Model performance is measured using evaluation metrics such as accuracy and a confusion matrix.

The methodology diagram that outlines the machine learning workflow was created using an AI-based tool.
